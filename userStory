User Story:

    I'm tired of having a tab open for both wikipedia and youtube when I'm researching for school projects. I would like to be able to view a video about my researched topic while I read the wiki article.

Criteria:

    - When the page is opened
    - Then I am presented with a search bar, my previous searches (max 5) and the wikipedia 
        article of the day synopsis, and 5 relevant YouTube Videos.
    - When I type something in search and submit it
    - Then I am presented with a wikipedia synopsis of the search, and the most relevant YouTube video.
    - When I click on an arrow beside the video
    - Then it gives me another relevant video, up to a maximum of 5.
    - When I hover over the side navbar
    - Then I am presented with a navbar containing the wikipedia table of contents from the searched article.
    - When I search something
    - Then a button or dropdown is added below the search bar, to quickly search it again (stored in local storage).
    - When the history button or dropdown is clicked
    - Then I am returned to the previous search.
